A Front-End web application for searching for movies. Users can search a movie by title, select which movie they're interested in, and view information about the movie such as its IMDB critic rating, trailer, runtime, if the movie is on Netflix to stream, and other related material.

## Instructions for use
1. Use the search card on the homescreen to search for a movie title you think you might be interested in.

2. The resulting page will display results from your search, and if you see the movie you were looking for you can click on it to be brought to a third page.

3. Check out the third page to watch the movie's trailer, or to view other detailed information!
